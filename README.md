This project is just to test out my learnings of html and is just for learning and Educational purpose.

In this project I am going to implement basic html tags such as <p>, <a>, <img> and heading tags and list tags such as <ol> and <ul>.

It will sound funny but I do not suggest you to follow the recipes for ingridients and steps for preparation given here. The project is made by me just as a fun exercise.
